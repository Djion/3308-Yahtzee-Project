##How to build, where to find docs
- Our documentation is generated by JSDocs. Their website can be found here : http://usejsdoc.org/
- In order to build the documents you need to have JSDocs and Node.js set up either globally or in the working directory (which this one does)
- Then run ./node_modules/.bin/jsdoc
- The output is in the form of an html file in the directory named out
- Our docs can be found there by running index.html in the out directory

##How to build/run/test
- Our code is javascript and html, building and running is as simple as launching the index.html and testing new code with your web browser of choice. 
- Could also use node.js
- Our unit tests are written in Python and can be found in the "UnitTesting" directory within our repository. To run the tests just type "python scoring_test.py" in the terminal and the results will be printed out.
- We only wrote tests for our scoring code because all the other code displays something in a browser so errors are very easily noticeable without specific unit tests.

## CI System?
- We did not use a continuous integration system.
